# This is a test project to retrieve data from API relating to weather in different cities and then to display that info.
Involves using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.

In order for this to work. The API keys for both Google and OpenWeather must be stored in a config.js file

An example would be:

var config = {
    apiKey: "ENTER_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY_HERE",
    googleApiKey: "enter_YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"
}
